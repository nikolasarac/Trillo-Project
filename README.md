# Trillo

This repository contains the project for the **Advanced CSS & SASS** course by Jonas Schmedtmann. Trillo is a fictional hotel booking / resort landing page, built primarily to demonstrate CSS Flexbox skills and responsive layout techniques.

## Overview

Trillo is a clean, modern landing site for a hotel/resort — showcasing rooms, hotel overview, reviews and a booking-call-to-action. The design relies heavily on Flexbox for layout, alignment and responsiveness. The site includes multiple sections such as header / navigation, hotel overview, description, user-reviews, and a call-to-action section — all structured to flexibly adapt to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3 / (optionally Sass)  
- CSS Flexbox for layout & positioning  
- Responsive Design (Media Queries)  

## Features

- **Flexbox Layout:** The whole page layout (header, navigation, hotel overview, reviews, CTA) is built using Flexbox to align and distribute elements properly. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- **Responsive Design:** Media queries ensure the site looks good on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Multiple Sections:** Header/navigation, overview, description, user reviews, and call-to-action sections give a realistic structure for a hotel/resort landing page. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
